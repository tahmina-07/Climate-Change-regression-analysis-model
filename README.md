# Climate-Change-regression-analysis-model
In this model I will use regression analysis to model the climate of different areas and try to find evidence of global warming. I will create models to analyze and visualize climate change in terms of temperature. 

I use temperature data obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
